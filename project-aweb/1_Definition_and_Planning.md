  The website will have a clear and logical structure:
  - **Homepage** → **Search Bar** → **Main Sections**: Dog Behaviors, Training Tips, Resources, and Contact.  
  - Each section will have subsections (e.g., under Dog Behaviors: Barking, Chewing, Play Behavior).
  
- **Technical Design:**  
  - **Front-End**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (for interactivity). Using frameworks like **React** or **Vue.js** to enhance dynamic content loading and responsiveness.
  - **Back-End**: **Node.js with Express** to manage user data, like saving progress for dog behavior logs and providing expert advice.  
  - **Database**: MongoDB to store user interactions, behavior logs, and educational content.
  - **API Integration**: Use REST APIs for fetching relevant dog behavior articles and tips.
  
- **Mobile and Accessibility Considerations:**  
  The design will be mobile-first, and I’ll ensure high **color contrast** for readability, **text alternatives** for images, and **accessible navigation** for users with disabilities.

The **information architecture and technical design** will be **comprehensive, detailed, and well-documented** to ensure easy navigation and a smooth user experience.

## **5. Project Management and User Testing**

- **Time Log:** Maintained in a separate GitHub page.

- **Development Phases**  
- **Phase 1:** Definition and Planning  
- **Phase 2:** Basic Structure and Main Function  
- **Phase 3:** Advanced Features and Optimization  
- **Phase 4:** Presentation  

- **User Testing:**  
  I will conduct **two rounds of user testing**:
    1. **Round 1:** Focused on navigation and clarity. Will involve observing users as they search for dog behaviors and navigate between sections.
    2. **Round 2:** Focused on advanced content interaction. Users will test logging progress and filtering advanced behavior studies.
  
  After gathering feedback, I’ll **refine** the design based on users' experiences, making necessary adjustments to enhance usability and engagement.
