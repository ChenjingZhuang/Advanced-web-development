# Project Phase 2 - Basic Structure and Main Functionalities

## 1. Environment

In this section, describe the development environment used for the project:
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or other.
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, npm, etc.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js for backend; React.js for frontend; PostgreSQL for database.

Example:
- **OS**: macOS 12.3
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, npm
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express.js for backend; React.js for frontend; PostgreSQL for database.

---

## 2. Backend

Provide a detailed description of the backend implementation:
- **API Setup**: Discuss the setup of the Express.js server, the endpoints, and the server's configuration.
- **Database Connection**: Describe the database connection to PostgreSQL, including how connections are handled, pooling, and error handling.
- **Authentication**: Explain any authentication mechanisms used, such as bcrypt for hashing passwords and JWT for managing sessions (if applicable).
- **Code Example**: Include code snippets for key functionality such as user registration and login.

Example:
The backend is built using Express.js, and the API includes endpoints for registering and logging in users. The PostgreSQL database is connected using `pg` package, with connection pooling for optimal performance.

---

## 3. Frontend

Explain the frontend setup:
- **Framework**: Discuss the use of React.js for creating the user interface, including the state management and routing setup (if used).
- **UI Components**: Describe the main UI components, like forms for registration and login, and how they communicate with the backend API.
- **Code Example**: Show the structure of a key frontend component (e.g., a login form or registration form) and its connection to the backend.

Example:
The frontend is built using React.js. State is managed using the `useState` hook, and forms communicate with the backend using Axios for HTTP requests.

---

## 4. Database

Detail the database schema and its structure:
- **Tables**: Discuss the `users` table, its columns (e.g., email, password), and constraints (e.g., UNIQUE for email).
- **Schema**: Provide the SQL code for creating the table, along with any indexes or relationships.
- **Sample Query**: Include an example of a query used to fetch or insert data (e.g., selecting a user by email).

Example:
The database schema contains a `users` table with columns `id`, `email`, and `password`. Email is unique to prevent duplicate entries.

---

## 5. Basic Structure and Architecture

Explain the high-level structure of your application:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Describe the communication between the frontend (client) and backend (server) using HTTP requests (REST API).
- **Folder Structure**: Briefly explain the folder structure of both the frontend and backend.
- **Modularity**: How is the project divided into smaller modules or components?

Example:
The project follows a client-server architecture with the backend handling business logic and the frontend managing user interactions. The backend communicates with PostgreSQL using the `pg` package.

---

## 6. Functionalities

Describe the main features and functionalities of the project:
- **User Registration**: Users can register with an email and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in using email and password with hashed password verification.
- **API Integration**: If applicable, mention any external APIs used (e.g., dog facts API in your case).

Example:
The application allows users to register and log in. During registration, passwords are hashed before being stored in the database. The app also integrates with an external dog facts API.

---

## 7. Code Quality and Documentation

Discuss the quality of the codebase:
- **Code Structure**: Are the files organized? Is the code modular and easy to read?
- **Comments**: Mention the presence of comments and documentation, both inline (for functions) and for the overall project (README).
- **Best Practices**: Mention adherence to best practices, such as using async/await, error handling, and modular design.

Example:
The code is organized into separate modules for backend logic, database interactions, and API routes. Inline comments are used to explain complex logic, and a README file provides an overview of the project.

---

## 8. Testing and Error Handling

Provide details about how you’ve handled testing and errors:
- **Error Handling**: How does the backend handle errors (e.g., database connection errors, user input validation errors)?
- **Testing**: Discuss any unit tests or integration tests you’ve implemented, and the testing tools used (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
- **Error Logging**: Mention any logging mechanisms, such as `console.error`, for debugging and error tracking.

Example:
Error handling is done using `try/catch` blocks in the backend, with appropriate status codes and messages returned to the frontend. There are no automated tests at this stage, but logging is done using `console.error`.

---

## 9. User Interface and Interaction

Discuss the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX):
- **UI Design**: Describe how the UI was designed, its responsiveness, and the interaction flow (e.g., registration and login forms).
- **UX Principles**: Are usability principles (e.g., simplicity, accessibility) followed?
- **Frontend Features**: Discuss the interactive elements like buttons, forms, and validation feedback.

Example:
The user interface is simple and user-friendly. The registration and login forms provide real-time feedback on invalid input. The design is responsive and accessible.

## Conclusion

Summarize the project's current progress and what’s left to accomplish. Mention any challenges faced, how they were overcome, and future steps for enhancing the application.
